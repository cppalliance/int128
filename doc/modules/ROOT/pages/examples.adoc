=== Signed 128-bit Arithmetic ===
x = 1000000000000
y = 999999999999

Addition and Subtraction:
x + y = 1999999999999
x - y = 1

Multiplication (exceeds 64-bit range):
x * y = 999999999999000000000000

Division and Modulo:
x / 7 = 142857142857
x % 7 = 1

Comparisons:
x > y:  true
x == y: false
x != y: true

Negative values:
negative = -42
abs(negative) = 42

Compound assignment operators:
z = 100
z += 50: 150
z -= 25: 125
z *= 2:  250
z /= 5:  50
z %= 7:  1

=== Unsigned 128-bit Arithmetic ===
large (2^64) = 18446744073709551616
large * 2 = 36893488147419103232
large + large = 36893488147419103232

Increment and Decrement:
counter = 10
++counter = 11
counter++ = 11
counter = 12
--counter = 11
