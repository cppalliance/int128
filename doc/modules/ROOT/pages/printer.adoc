= Pretty Printers
:idprefix: pretty_printers_

Pretty printers allow debuggers to display `uint128_t` and `int128_t` values in human-readable decimal format instead of showing the raw struct members.
The library contains pretty printers for LLDB and GDB in the `extra/` folder.

== LLDB

To use this, add the following line to your `~/.lldbinit` file:

[source]
----
command script import /path/to/int128/extra/int128_printer.py
----

If this is successful, you should see the following message in your debugger upon startup:

`"int128_t and uint128_t pretty printers loaded successfully"`

== GDB

To load the pretty printer, add the following line to your `.gdbinit`:

[source]
----
source /path/to/int128/extra/int128_printer_gdb.py
----

or you can source it manually in GDB.

[source]
----
(gdb) source /path/to/int128/extra/int128_printer_gdb.py
----
