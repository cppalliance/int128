= Configuration Macros
:idprefix: config_

== User Configurable Macros

- `BOOST_INT128_NO_BUILTIN_INT128`: The user may define this when they do not want the internal implementations to rely on builtin `\__int128` or `unsigned __int128` types.

== Automatic Configuration Macros

- `BOOST_INT128_HAS_INT128`: This is defined when compiling on a platform that has builtin `\___int128` or `unsigned __int128` types (e.g. `\__x86_64___`).
