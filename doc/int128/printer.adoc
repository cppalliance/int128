= Pretty Printers
:idprefix: pretty_printers_

The library contains a pretty printer for LLDB in the `extra/` folder.
To use this, add the following line to your `~/.lldbinit` file:

[source]
----
command script import /path/to/int128/extra/int128_printer.py
----

If this is successful, you should see the following message in your debugger upon startup:

"int128_t and uint128_t pretty printers loaded successfully"
