[#cstdlib]
= `<cstdlib>`
:idprefix: cstdlib_

From the `<cstdlib>` header we support functions and structures that are analogous to https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/div.html[`std::div`].
These are of particular importance with this library since unlike a hardware type, the compiler may not be able to optimize a division followed by a modulo operation.
Knuth's algorithm naturally returns both so it costs nearly nothing above a division or modulo to get both results.

[#div_structs]
[source, c++]
----
#include <boost/int128/cstdlib.hpp>

namespace boost {
namespace int128 {

struct u128div_t
{
    uint128_t quot;
    uint128_t rem;
};

struct i128div_t
{
    int128_t quot;
    int128_t rem;
};

} // namespace int128
} // namespace boost

----

[#div_source]
Using the `struct`s defined above we can then define the `div` function:

[source, c++]
----
#include <boost/int128/cstdlib.hpp>

namespace boost {
namespace int128 {

constexpr u128div_t div(uint128_t lhs, uint128_t rhs) noexcept;

constexpr i128div_t div(int128_t lhs, int128_t rhs) noexcept;

} // namespace int128
} // namespace boost
----

The result of `quot` and `rem` from this function, to include the sign, are the same as if you did a division and modulo separately.
